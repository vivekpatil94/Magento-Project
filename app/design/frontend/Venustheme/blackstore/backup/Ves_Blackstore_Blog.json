They have built a successful wholesale business in the US and Europe, but their long-term strategy is to build an online presence that drives consumer direct purchases worldwide.<\/p>\r\n<p>Venroy started selling through major retailers like Nordstrom&rsquo;s and high-end hotel boutiques. The company quickly lost control of their brand and customer experience as they tried to fit into an existing supply chain model. Their initial website was built on older technology and highlighted their partner boutiques to generate the wholesale business. Based on the confines of the wholesale business model, Venroy made a strategic shift to focus solely on a consumer direct model. Core to this strategy are their new online and physical stores.<\/p>\r\n<p>Their existing site was difficult to manage and maintain and couldn&rsquo;t scale to support their online growth. &nbsp;The team couldn&rsquo;t create the kind of brand experience they wanted given the lack of flexibility of their existing platform including limited ability to customize features. They knew they needed a new site before the busy summer season. And they needed it fast.<\/p>\r\n<p>The new site, built on Magneto 2.0, is consumer focused with the goal of getting website visitors to buy direct online or through their new physical store. Magento 2.0 gave them complete control over the shopping experience and lets them tell their story and communicate directly with customers. Critical to the project was a time-to-market requirement to have the site live to launch Venroy&rsquo;s summer collection.<br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Magento 2 has played an important role in helping us reclaim our brand and reconnect with our customers. With a production schedule of only 8 weeks, we were able to use much of Magento&rsquo;s capabilities &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; to deliver a unique, mobile optimized brand experience. Magento has transformed our business and delivered exceptional results from the get go,&ldquo; said Sean Venturi, co-founder of Venroy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Venroy selected Magento based on a strategic recommendation from Magento Gold Solution Partner, <a href=\"http:\/\/partners.magento.com\/partner_locator\/partner_details.aspx?id=92954\" target=\"_blank\">Netstarter<\/a>. Venroy needed a scalable solution that could drive business growth and support their transition to a B2C model. The Netstarter team recommended Magento 2.0 because it supported all of the key project requirements &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo;, and the solution could be delivered with minimal customization to the core code.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><img src=\"https:\/\/magento.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/venroy-pdp%20770x433.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" \/><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It was important that the new platform allowed Venroy to implement a completely customized design interface that captured their brand identity and gave them the flexibility to easily and cost-effectively make updates for seasonal collections. They were able create this mobile-friendly, custom look fast by leveraging Magento 2.0&rsquo;s responsive design reference theme and flexible frontend framework.<\/p>\r\n<p>Magento 2.0 was easy for Venroy to customize in other ways. The modular codebase supported efficient implementation of custom modules for Venroy&rsquo;s loyalty and referral programs. Strategic integrations with key services such as Braintree (payment processing), and Dotmailer (marketing automation) were also easily implemented and configured.<\/p>\r\n<p>They also used the optimized checkout process included in Magento 2.0 to eliminate unnecessary steps and streamline the user journey. In fact, the new checkout has driven higher conversion rates and the post purchase account creation feature has helped increase the number of registered customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Magento 2.0&rsquo;s mature cache implementation with Varnish delivered fantastic performance with minimal configuration. The touch-friendly Admin interface was a welcomed addition as the team frequently accesses the backend via a mobile device to process orders and perform urgent content management. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Since launching the new site in November 2015, Venroy has experienced some encouraging results:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>38% increase in the site wide conversion rate<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>60% increase in the mobile conversion rate<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>40% decrease in the average page load times<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Over 50% increase in the Google PageSpeed Insights score<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The ability for Venroy to leverage so many built-in features enabled them to create a powerful and compelling online experience in about 2 months &ndash; in plenty of time for the summer sales.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>","short_content":"<p>The new site, built on Magneto 2.0, is consumer focused with the goal of getting website visitors to buy direct online or through their new physical store.

Byredo is wholly owned by Manzanita Capital, a venture capital firm investing in home and beauty brands.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.manzanitacapital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Manzanita Capital<\/a> was at a technological crossroads. Each of their portfolio brands was considering replatforming their eCommerce solution. The team standardized their approach on Magento 2.0 in order to improve cost efficiency and leverage development efforts across their portfolio.<\/p>\r\n<p>Manzanita Capital chose Byredo as the Beta site for Magento 2.0 based on their innovative business model and brand identity. Their existing platform was cumbersome and kept them from conveying their unique brand style effectively. The company needed an eCommerce platform that could scale to support their global expansion, and they weren&rsquo;t confident that their current platform could keep up. As with the other portfolio companies, eCommerce will be a main sales channel driving future Byredo revenue. Having a scalable and flexible platform that enabled them to create a differentiated global brand experience was critical for their business.<\/p>\r\n<p>Manzanita Capital and Byredo looked for a platform that could handle the complexity of multiple brands in multiple countries all running on a common backend. Under the leadership of Gold Solution Partner, <a href=\"http:\/\/partners.magento.com\/partner_locator\/partner_details.aspx?id=92862\" target=\"_blank\">Session Digital Ltd<\/a>., the team went through an extensive RFP process. They evaluated Demandware, and Hybris but found these solutions too big, too expensive and not nearly as flexible as Magento 2.0.<\/p>\r\n<p>The availability of a modern tech stack and code base, responsive design templates and efficient libraries, gave the team the flexibility they needed to design and deliver unique shopping experiences for each brand.&nbsp; The &ldquo;out-of-the box&rdquo; enterprise performance and scalability clearly supported their anticipated growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Magento 2.0 allows us to spend time on creative rather than code. The functionality available out-of-the-box was easy to learn and work with. We can leverage the back-end platform across our portfolio while still delivering unique customer experiences for each brand,&rdquo; said Rob Bostock, Director of Technology for SpaceNK (a Manzanita Capital portfolio company) and the driving force behind the move to Magento 2.0.<\/p>\r\n<p>The investment in Magento 2.0 positioned the company for the future, as they started with the newest technology and were confident of the upgrade path. The entire project including design, development, build and testing was completed in three-and-a-half months allowing Byredo to launch in advance of the busy holiday shopping season.&nbsp;<br \/> <\/p>\r\n<p>The impact of the new site has been significant. Year-over-year (December 2014 to December 2015), it showed an increase in eCommerce transactions of more than 30% while the average order value has jumped 160%. Plus, total mobile sessions have gone up by more than 50% and the conversions are up by more than 30%.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ahhh&hellip;the sweet smell of success.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: OpenSansBold;\">Hear more about Magento 2.0 from Byredo&rsquo;s Solution Partner, Session Digital:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yA3XFJ49P9w?list=PLemW25-IIsdvqGhsMXXkW66-P_fjU8X88\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>","short_content":"<p>As magento promised, Magento 2 GA will be released in the next few weeks.

The data also highlighted the shifting focus of mid-market players&rsquo; digitization investments, marking a departure from the back office and operations-focused spending that has defined digitization activities in the past.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unique among participating industries, the retail and wholesale sector has experienced a sea change led by technology and shifting consumer expectations. On the heels of NRF last week, here are a few unique insights for the retail industry:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Mounting pressure to digitize retail and wholesale trade<\/strong><br \/> As brick-and-mortar stores struggle to keep up with strong online competition, the pressure to digitize has never been greater. While more than three quarters (78 percent) of retail and wholesale trade businesses say digitization is important relative to other business priorities, retail lags other sectors in the priority it places on digitization who rate digitization importance at 90 to 93 percent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Bogged down by complexity and slow progress<\/strong><br \/> Not surprisingly, retailers and wholesalers were more likely to report a slower pace of digitization than other industries (37 percent). Integrating with legacy systems combined with a failure to prioritize the implementation of digitization efforts contribute to the problem. While the average payoff timeframe for digitization projects is three years, many firms cited waiting up to five years or more to realize a return on their investment.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Wake up and smell the innovation<\/strong><br \/> The study revealed that most retail digitization investment goes towards back office operations (e.g. accounting) and facilitating current business (sales, customer service, marketing and logistics), with only 8 percent currently being invested in innovation projects which are important drivers of future growth and profitability for these companies. As the barriers to embracing next-era technologies dissipate, retailers will need to step up their game or get left behind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>New Year, New Me for Retail<\/strong><br \/> The data revealed that the business services and technology sector had the greatest percentage (50 percent) of companies that consider themselves digitally advanced, while more than one third of retailers (35 percent) feel somewhat or very far behind on digital readiness, leading 29 percent to increase their investment in digitization projects in the next 12 months.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>\"Clearly, the study validates that improving digitization is important to every industry in the digital age and that technology is rewriting the rules of the game. Businesses that are complacent or just average in this area will get left behind,\" said Peter Sheldon, Chief Strategy Officer, Magento Commerce. \"To keep pace, companies must take necessary steps to address key digitization barriers and move quickly to successfully adopt next-era digital tools. In doing so, these businesses secure not only continued relevance, but also superior returns and growth.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>To learn more about the study:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/magento.com\/company\/press-room\/press-releases\/new-study-maps-role-digitization-growth-middle-market-companies\" target=\"_blank\">Read the press release<\/a><\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/magento.com\/resources\/fastest-growing-middle-market-study\" target=\"_blank\">Download the full report<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>","short_content":"<p>The research, &ldquo;How Digital Are You?,&rdquo; found that the fastest-growing middle market firms place a greater emphasis on digitization than their similar-sized counterparts.

Follow Peter Sheldon on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/peter_sheldon\" target=\"_blank\">@PETER_SHELDON<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>With 2016 upon us, it&rsquo;s a good time to look ahead to four key trends gathering momentum in the New Year, and look at what drastic changes the industry will see and what cool new technologies shoppers will be able to take advantage of at scale (don&rsquo;t worry, we won&rsquo;t mention drones!).<\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Brick &amp; Mortar is Dead! Long live brick &amp; mortar!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Many are interpreting the data from this past holiday season as a further indicator of the imminent demise of brick and mortar stores, and in some ways that&rsquo;s true. We all know that brick and mortar giants are feeling the crunch. They are increasingly unable to compete with the convenience and competitive pricing environment of the online shopping experience. Now even the age old physical advantages of face-to-face product expertise and same day availability have been battered by online content superiority and same day shipping options.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Doom and gloom aside, some bright spots remain. Industries like apparel require a customer to be able to try on, touch, feel, and interact with the products they&rsquo;re buying. No easy return policy, no pre-labeled shipping packaging or sizing intelligence platform will ever fully replace that.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">But that doesn&rsquo;t mean apparel isn&rsquo;t going through its own transformation, and it&rsquo;s one that will only heat up in 2016. More and more, apparel brands are embracing technologies that blend the best of in-store and online experience, from in-store pick-up to connected fitting rooms and digitally-enabled concierge services. The boldest seek to combine multiple new-to-market innovations to completely digitize the in-store buying experience&mdash;<\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\" href=\"https:\/\/magento.com\/videos\/imagine\/rebecca-minkoff\">Rebecca Minkoff<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> is a great example&mdash;and make the soft goods stores of today look nothing like where your mother shopped.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Mobile Tipping Point<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>While it seems every holiday season for the last five years has been proclaimed &ldquo;the year of mobile,&rdquo; in 2015 mobile transaction volumes really started to live up to the hype. In the face of declining in-store traffic, mobile sales <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/smartphones-save-black-friday-sale-2015-400058\">accounted for <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/smartphones-save-black-friday-sale-2015-400058\">36 percent<\/a> of all Black Friday purchases.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The mobile experience today is significantly superior than years past, but what are the forces driving consumer confidence in transactions on mobile devices?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Big screens rule.<\/strong> As consumers go through yet another handset replacement cycle, larger screen real-estate (thank you Tim Cook for the iPhone 6 &amp; 6+) has given savvy mobile web developers more creative freedom to pack in more visible content without sacrificing usability on these devices.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Higher bandwidth becomes (almost) ubiquitous.<\/strong> For those North Americans living near a metropolitan core, access to 4G bandwidth is rapidly becoming a commodity. Combined, this access to fast content delivery with mobile web acceleration technologies like Front End Optimization (FEO) and experimentation with new mobile web technologies like single page applications (SPA&rsquo;s) and many of todays mobile web experiences now rival the performance of their desktop forefathers.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>HTML form controls quietly die.<\/strong> An obsession for mobile first, touch and gesture optimized experiences have led mobile developers to quietly put to rest HTML controls like the radio button, checkbox and dropdown list. These venerable controls have served us well, but on mobile there is simply a better way to use vector graphics and touchable icons to enable frictionless navigation and selection.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Checkout &amp; payment friction dissipates. <\/strong>Online retailers are investing in increasingly clever ways to simplify and automate the mobile checkout process from social authentication, Google maps powered address autocomplete, and the removal of all but the most critical field entry forms. Combined with the rollout of mobile checkout innovations such as PayPal OneTouch and Apple Pay, making a purchase on mobile is getting easier than ever.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Over the next two years, we&rsquo;re well on track to reach a new mobile tipping point where fifty percent of all commerce transactions take place on a mobile device. This surge in mobile commerce adoption will bring about a paradigm shift in the way developers approach user experience design. Historically, responsive design was used to make the desktop experience accessible and adequately usable across an increasingly diverse mobile device universe. In 2016, we will see new &ldquo;mobile first&rdquo; obsessions emerge, where &ldquo;usable&rdquo; no longer cuts it. Instead, this obsession for creating highly optimized mobile first experiences will make the mobile experience the de facto starting point. Responsive web design (RWD) will be then be used in an inverse manner to make next generation mobile experiences &ldquo;usable&rdquo; on the desktop.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Social Selling, the Engine of Discovery<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>As customers embrace mobile&mdash;and as retailers increasingly capitalize on social media as a powerful channel for customer engagement&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see social media become the default starting point for the retail journey. For retailers, this means greater investment in technologies like <a href=\"https:\/\/business.pinterest.com\/en\/blog\/new-merchants-and-platforms-buyable-pins\">Pinterest&rsquo;s Buyable Pins<\/a>. What may have previously been an afterthought in a company&rsquo;s marketing strategy will come to the foreground as retailers create deep, curated content to attract, engage and retain loyal customers. Early adopters will be rewarded; those who fail to catch on will find themselves behind and hastily trying to put together a social content strategy.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Virtual Reality: Not Just for Spotty Teenagers<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In 2016, Oculus Rift will for sure top birthday wish lists of almost every male between the age of seven and 22, but virtual reality holds an exciting promise beyond a new (and slightly bizarre) ski goggle fashion craze. While brick and mortar retailers will integrate more digital experiences into their stores, branded manufacturers will tap virtual reality to enable almost &lsquo;real world&rsquo; like product discovery and engagement experiences from the home. While not every household will invest in expensive VR hardware like Oculous Rift, the emergence of more accessible and affordable virtual reality technology (like the Samsung gear headset) and even Google cardboard wearables will make virtualized product discovery an increasingly valuable and rewarding experience for consumers.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The automotive industry is a great example. Buying a car has always been a harrowing process that required multiple visits to car dealerships to test drive a car and choose optional features followed by hours of haggling and paperwork to complete the transaction. And while companies like <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wYntsIIn9xY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=UU9sQv85HzNIwvuMDTGp2NCw\">Rockar and Hyundai<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> are reimagining the experience with the customer at the center, car manufacturers like <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ODTZ709v90k\">Volvo<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> are already using VR mobile apps to allow potential buyers to take a virtual test drive.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The 2016 Test: Keeping Pace With Customer Expectations<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Undoubtedly, 2016 will bring a sea change to retail, from the shifting mobile paradigm to experimentation with virtual reality in the shopping experience. But before we get our shovels ready to bury brick and mortar for good, we&rsquo;ll need to keep any schadenfreude in check: At today&rsquo;s pace of technology innovation and change, the next disruption could be closer than we think. The spoils of the New Year will go to those who embrace the adage &ldquo;think big, act small, fail fast and learn quickly&rdquo; because in 2016, customer expectations will wait for no one.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>","short_content":"<p>Many are interpreting the data from this past holiday season as a further indicator of the imminent demise of brick and mortar stores, and in some ways that&rsquo;s true.

They saw an opportunity to grow their business and rebrand the online experience. The goal for the new brand was to continue growing the business beyond the store by creating an online version of their fun, unique and personal in-store experience. Designing the new website was about giving customers what they wanted&mdash;a convenient and personal experience. The company needed a platform that could handle the demands of a very stylized site design, seamlessly scale to support their projected growth, and provide the added functionality their vision will require over time.<\/p>\r\n<p>SOL partnered with Magento 2 Trained Solution Partner&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/partners.magento.com\/partner_locator\/partner_details.aspx?id=92977\" target=\"_blank\">Guidance<\/a>&nbsp;to bring their vision to life. SOL was using Magento Community Edition, but wanted a more sophisticated platform that could scale to support future growth of their online business, and allow significant levels of personalization and social media integration to help deliver their unique online experience. When Guidance recommended upgrading to Magento Enterprise Edition 2.0, the team was all in.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We quickly realized that growing the business meant growing the online business. Magento opens up the possibility of using technology to provide customers with the same fun SOL experience online as they get instore. The value of the online customer experience is what it&rsquo;s all about. That&rsquo;s what will drive our growth,&rdquo; says Jeanie Peterson, Co-Founder of SOL.<\/p>\r\n<p>The architecture, performance and scalability of Magento 2.0 allowed SOL to hit the ground running, handle the increased traffic and number of SKUs, and positioned them to be more significant eCommerce player in their industry. By leveraging the out-of-box responsive design theme, they improved conversions on mobile devices as well as Google search rankings. In fact, mobile and tablet devices accounted for 48% of all site traffic in November and December 2015, and 27% of all eCommerce conversions.<\/p>\r\n<p>The company was able to take advantage of the extensive ecosystem of solutions available for Magento 2.0 to deliver exactly the experiences their customers want. Everything from integration with their POS system, to appointment scheduling and visual order history was available through partner-developed extensions.

But with 2016 right round the corner, retailers should be taking key learnings from these now-annual events and strategising on how to best manage their channels to create the best experience possible for customers next year.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In 2016 everything points to connectedness, convenience and service &ndash; all of which a good retailer knows in their bones. As such, retailers need to ensure they are addressing three key areas:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Be Visible on the Right Channels<\/strong> &ndash; using the appropriate digital tools will help make retailers the first choice for customers. Black Friday 2015 was a real example where consumers clearly chose online channels over instore.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Simplify the Customer Journey<\/strong> &ndash; making the user journey as simple as possible to navigate and complete, from the in-store experience, to mobile, tablet, and website.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Ensure a Fair and Efficient<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>R<\/strong><strong>eturns and Complaint Resolution Process <\/strong>&ndash; so as to protect the brand&rsquo;s reputation with the increase in social sharing.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the home retail industry there will always be products customers will want to see and interact with before they commit to a purchase and, as such, the multichannel capabilities of the home goods market are currently fairly low in comparison to other categories. But there is scope to make improvements and technology will play a significant part in bridging the on and offline worlds for a better customer experience.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Next year the technology we expect to see take prominence include:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Beacons &ndash; <\/strong>Useful for tracking the customer&rsquo;s journey around the shop, identifying any pain points which prevent a sale, or alerting retailers when customers arrive, beacons can provide invaluable insights of consumer behaviour. They are also a handy tool when retailers are unable to display their full range of products in store. By placing beacons on products, the customer can bring up the whole range of product information and variations to improve their purchasing decisions.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Clienteling Apps &ndash; <\/strong>By informing retailers of consumers&rsquo; purchase history and the potential for cross and up selling, as well as when purchases take place, staff can provide a personalised experience to loyal customers.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Click and Collect <\/strong>&ndash; Enhancing the pick-up experience by encouraging retailers to think about the lay out of their store for when customers pick up goods provides an opportunity for customers to find other items of interest and for the retailer to up sell products.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2016 poses an exciting time for retailers, with the evolution of technologies enabling them to provide an optimum customer experience. However in order to provide the experience consumers desire, retailers need to focus in on their needs and apply those technologies that best match their circumstances, making their shopping experience more personalised, efficient and synchronised, allowing customers to shop between the different channels as they please.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Iain Devine is Commercial Director at global digital commerce consultancy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salmon.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Salmon<\/a>, overseeing its marketing, strategic business partnerships and sales.

Gift Cards","identifier":"gift-everyones-list-gift-cards","content":"<div class=\"field-item even\">\r\n<p>Gift cards rank high on everyone&rsquo;s holiday wish lists. According to The UK Gift Card &amp; Voucher Association (UKGCVA), gift card and voucher sales have been steadily increasing in the UK, with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.retailtimes.co.uk\/growth-in-consumer-sales-of-gift-cards-and-vouchers-continues-uk-gift-card-voucher-association-reports\/\" target=\"_blank\">6.14 percent increase<\/a> in Q4 of 2014, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk\/digital-marketing-news\/gift-card-and-voucher-sales-see-significant-growth\/2580\" target=\"_blank\">9.7 percent increase<\/a> in B2B gift card and vouchers sales in the first half of 2015. This growth isn&rsquo;t likely to slow as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/2015\/research-reveals-why-uk-consumers-purchase-gift-cards\/\" target=\"_blank\">largest group of gift card buyers&mdash;the digital-savvy, under-thirty-five crowd<\/a>&mdash;is just flexing its buying power.<\/p>\r\n<p>At One4all, we produce the market-leading multi-store gift card, available online and in Post Offices throughout the UK and Ireland, and accepted in over 22,000 outlets in the UK and over 7,000 outlets in Ireland.<\/p>\r\n<p>At first glance, the One4all seems like a simple product, and in many ways it is. Our gift card can be purchased online, then spent by a recipient in over 30,000 outlets in the UK and Ireland, or online with selected retailers. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a straightforward concept, but with a range of card designs, hundreds of retailers to manage, a personalisation product and more, all across two distinct markets, it is deceptively complex&mdash;and with our market growing, we&rsquo;re growing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since launching our sites on the Magento platform in 2012, in conjunction with our development partner <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monsoonconsulting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Monsoon Consulting<\/a>, Magento&rsquo;s long list of features and plugins has enabled us to grow the One4all web sales channel from a token 2% to double figures in the space of a few short years, with exponential growth projected for 2016.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s no coincidence. Seamless integration with <a href=\"http:\/\/partners.magento.com\/partner_locator\/partner_details.aspx?id=93747\" target=\"_blank\">dotmailer<\/a> has allowed us to create automated email campaigns for purchasers, basket abandoners and more, requiring minimal initial groundwork for continued returns throughout the year. Magento&rsquo;s membership functionality has enabled us to build a loyal base of One4all members and market to them year-round with promotions and retailer offers.<\/p>\r\n<p>These improvements have resulted in huge increases in all the right places: revenue is up an average of 70% against 2014, our conversion rate is up 14% and we have now reached over 110,000 members across both markets. As more businesses choose to reward their staff with One4all Gift Cards, we continue to scale our use of the platform to meet the growing demand.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>About Sam Wheway<\/strong><br \/> Sam Wheway takes care of digital and corporate marketing for One4all Gift Cards in the UK and Ireland.

In fact, the earlier you start 2016 preparations, the better you will be positioned to leverage the traffic and subsequent data that you have gathered over Q4, allowing you to generate long-term, happy customers that return to your store long after the holiday decorations are back in storage.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While personalization has been a hot trend for a couple of years now, 2016 will see it move from an optional extra to a requirement for any successful business. So, to help you blast off into 2016, we here at Nosto have collected seven actionable tips:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1. <\/strong><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Collect Email Addresses for Retargeting in 2016<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In Q4 you will get a lot of new traffic to your store. Take advantage of this by using pop-ups to help you increase the chance of festive sales while simultaneously capturing contact details for the future.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Two effective examples of this include:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Pop-ups which offer new visitors a discount in exchange for a subscription to your newsletter.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Pop-ups to be triggered by exit intent of unidentified users, offering to send an email with items that the customer has left in their cart.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Both of these options allow you to provide excellent customer service, incentivize and encourage shoppers to make purchases and help you capture the data you need to re-target them in 2016 with highly personalized recommendations or offers. It&rsquo;s a win-win!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"width: 949px; height: 489px; margin: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/magento.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/dreamandfun_popup.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>New customer pop-up at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreamandfun.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.dreamandfun.com<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Follow Up on December Orders<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so you have the email addresses, now what? First and foremost, send automated Order Follow up emails targeting customers with highly relevant items to those purchased in December. A great Follow-up email would also include a list of hottest items in your selection right now for a chance to show off your new spring selection and thus entice customers back to your store. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">3. Build Relationships Through &lsquo;We Miss You&rsquo; Emails<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Triggered emailing is the holy grail of customer retention. That&rsquo;s why it earns two points in the list! Reach out to your customers with an automated &lsquo;We Miss You&rsquo; email triggered when the customer has not visited your store for a while. Populate the email with highly relevant and personalized product recommendations that indicate to your customer that you have learned their likes and dislikes. This will help you build a more personal relationship with them and make them more likely to return shopping with you.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img style=\"width: 1224px; height: 1474px; margin: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/magento.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/melvinhamilton_WMY.png\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/> <em>A we miss you email by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.melvin-hamilton.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.melvin-hamilton.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">4. Enable Personalized Facebook Ads to Re-engage Customers<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Take advantage of the seasonal social media buzz and display automatically tailored offers directly in your customers&rsquo; newsfeeds. Target customers who have visited your store previously by recommending products picked just for them (e.g. items they browsed but didn&rsquo;t go on to purchase) or by suggesting items that are highly relevant to items that converted customers have already bought.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"width: 652px; height: 536px; margin: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/magento.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/Stuttenham_FB.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Personalized Facebook ads of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stutterheim.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.stutterheim.com<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> <strong>5. Display Attention Grabbers on Your Home Page<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>As you know, not all gifts hit home and you&rsquo;ll be getting quite a few returns and exchanges in late December and throughout January. Fret not; there is an upside! It means that these customers are likely to come back to your store either to look for items to replace a gift or to learn about your returns terms. Make sure these customers are immediately greeted with the hottest new items in your selection to capture their interest again and ultimately complete a purchase. To increase conversion, add a top list and display personalized recommendations on your front page so that items the customer is most likely to purchase are the ones they see first.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"width: 1213px; height: 544px; margin: 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/magento.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/Yumikim%20personalized%20recs.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Personalized recommendations on the front page of <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yumikim.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>www.yumikim.com<\/em><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">6. Give Out Coupons for January Purchases<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, by the time January rolls around we are all feeling the pinch (and we don&rsquo;t just mean from tighter-than-normal trousers!)<strong>. <\/strong>This means that shoppers are more likely to be discount-lead than normal. Delight these bargain hunters with a discount coupon for use in January when they complete a purchase in December. It&rsquo;s a simple and small surprise but one that will bring them back to your store despite a less than happy looking bank-account.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Reward Your Best Customers<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>New Year&rsquo;s is about new beginnings. Thank your best customers for the year past by sending them a small gift. This can be anything from a physical gift in your selection to a time-limited discount or other incentives that are exclusive to them. If you have the resources, do something even better, write them a personalized handwritten note to thank them for 2015 (A great example of exceptional customer service was<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/reddit.com\/comments\/eabag\/i_have_never_in_my_life_seen_this_level_of\/\" target=\"_blank\"> posted on Reddit<\/a> a while back). They&rsquo;ll get more for less, return to your store, and you get more happy customers to kick off your 2016!<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>About Nosto<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>New to personalization and not sure how to get started?

When he reached the peak, at 17,040 ft., the exhausted climber proudly unfurled his flag.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today Andrii is a quality engineer at the Magento developer, Eltrino. He has now waved a Magento flag atop three other mountains in the Caucasus region. &nbsp;&ldquo;My job is still connected with the Magento platform,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;and the Magento 2.0 launch is a really important event.&rdquo; Andrii still wears a Magento sticker on his trusty safety helmet.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"width: 183px; height: 220px; padding-right: 25px; float: left;\" src=\"http:\/\/magento.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/-NMChvbW2Cw%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Like Magento, Andrii is always looking to reach new heights.

Magento 2.0 also offers enhanced performance and scalability, &nbsp;new features to boost conversion rates, and business agility and productivity improvements. The new platform also builds on our open source heritage and offers unmatched flexibility and innovation opportunities to our global ecosystem of partners and developers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two new products based on this powerful platform are available for download today: Magento Enterprise Edition 2.0 and Magento Community Edition 2.0.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Open, Flexible Architecture<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Underpinning these new releases is a next-generation architecture that offers unmatched flexibility to bring your commerce vision to life.

Over the years, Chef Bob, as we like to call him, has created mouth-watering meals for our family to enjoy together. While he&rsquo;s spent years perfecting his pot roast, we were definitely subjected to a few less-than-appealing dinners along the way (I&rsquo;ll spare you the gory details of the macaroni and cheese incident of &rsquo;93). Chef Bob&rsquo;s tastiest meals always shared one common trait: they began with his bright orange Le Creuset Dutch oven.<\/p>\r\n<p>That piece of Le Creuset cookware was also the foundation of my cooking lessons. I watched and learned as Chef Bob taught me how to properly brown meat before placing the enameled cast-iron pot in the oven while reminding me, &ldquo;Low and slow is the way to go.&rdquo; Like other home cooks, my dad sang the praises of Le Creuset&rsquo;s quality, noting that the orange Dutch oven would eventually become part of my kitchen, unintentionally creating the emotional connection the company so often finds in its customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ninety years ago,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lecreuset.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Le Creuset<\/a>&nbsp;debuted its signature enameled cast iron cocotte and has since expanded its offerings to include stainless steel, silicone and stoneware. From a single product in 1925, the company has grown along with the demands of its consumers, inspiring them to create joy through cooking.<\/p>\r\n<p>For a company built on tradition and heritage, Le Creuset continues to excel at redefining its brand to include modern design, and its eCommerce site is no exception. Celebrating its 90th anniversary in 2015, the company identified an opportunity to rebrand the site to create a more rewarding user experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Located in our shared city of Charleston, South Carolina, Le Creuset turned to Blue Acorn to create a modern, intuitive eCommerce site that would also capture the 90-year-old company&rsquo;s respect for tradition and authenticity. Le Creuset selected&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.magento.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Magento Enterprise Edition<\/a>, in part, because the scalable platform allows for seamless international expansion.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Blue Acorn understood our desire to balance world class content and compelling visual presentation with seamless transactional performance. Having an agency of their global caliber in our shared American home of Charleston was the icing on the cake,&rdquo; said Stephen Jones, vice president of marketing at Le Creuset.<\/p>\r\n<p>After defining design principles based on the timeless&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bauhaus\" target=\"_blank\">Bauhaus<\/a>&nbsp;concept, Blue Acorn worked with Le Creuset&rsquo;s team of marketers, designers and photographers to rebrand the Le Creuset experience, from in-store to online. The new, responsive eCommerce site features engaging ways to shop for and filter products including by color, size, function and type of material with the swipe of a finger.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Internet has become a go-to source for easily accessible cooking tips and recipes by celebrity chefs and home cooks alike. The redesign includes robust content, such as recipes and profiles of top chefs, to create a captivating online cooking experience that appeals to Le Creuset&rsquo;s emotionally-guided customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Magento Enterprise Edition&rsquo;s open-source technology performs at its best when amplified by best-of-breed technologies.
